# Japanese to Romaji Filename Converter
Works for any file with a japanese name (hiragana/kanji/katakana). Converts the filename into romaji with the help of Google Translator.

Note: This overrides the selected files with the new converted filenames.

For audio files it also converts the metadata tags for:
- Title
- Contributing artists
- Album artists
- Album

## Current Features
- Convert files from japanese to romaji (including metadata)
- Revert files (and metadata) back to their original names after a conversion

## Usage
Note: Please unzip the folder before using it so that the conversion-history file can be written to permanently.

## Runtime Dependencies

## Development Dependencies
